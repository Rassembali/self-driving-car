# â€‹ Self-Driving Car in GTA V â€” Hybrid AI Approach

**Autonomous navigation in a simulated open-world environment using computer vision, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.**

![Pipeline](outputs/images/pipeline.png)

---

## â€‹ Overview
This project implements and evaluates a self-driving car system inside the **Grand Theft Auto V** simulation environment.

It combines:
- **Perception** â€” semantic segmentation via **YOLOv8**
- **Control** â€” supervised learning (behavioral cloning) & reinforcement learning (PPO)
- **Hybrid Learning** â€” merging supervised & RL for adaptability

The agent drives **using only visual input** â€” no GPS, LiDAR, or radar.

---

## â€‹ Objectives
- Develop a **visual-only** self-driving system.
- Explore lane detection, semantic segmentation, behavioral cloning, and PPO.
- Compare **pure supervised** vs **hybrid supervised+RL** approaches.
- Deploy in real-time simulation.

## â€‹â€‹ Methodology

### â€‹â€‹â€‹ Perception: Semantic Segmentation
- Dataset: *Playing for Data* GTA V dataset (TU Darmstadt)
- Classes used: Road, Sidewalk, Car, Person
- Best Model: **YOLOv8**
- **Results:**

### â€‹â€‹â€‹ Control Approaches

#### **Supervised Learning â€” Behavioral Cloning**
- **Best Model:** CNN V2 (DeepDriveNet) â€” Validation accuracy: **76.7%**
- **Training Comparison:**

---

#### **Reinforcement Learning â€” PPO**
- PPO chosen over DQN for stability in continuous tasks.
- Reward from segmentation masks:
  - `+1` on road
  - `-1` sidewalk
  - `-1.5` collision with car/person
- **Reward Visuals:**

#### **Hybrid Model**
- Start with supervised CNN policy.
- Fine-tune with PPO for better recovery & adaptability.

## â€‹â€‹ Deployment

Implemented two real-time pipelines:

1. **CNN Deployment** â€” captures frame, preprocesses, predicts action â†’ maps to keypress â†’ drives in GTA V  
2. **PPO Deployment** â€” captures frame, preprocesses, PPO predicts action â†’ maps to keypress â†’ drives in GTA V
